# weather-app

<h5>Live project [here](https://oconnor-marvin.github.io/weather-app/)</h5>

<p>I created this page as part of the Odin Project in order to utilise what I had learnt about asynchronous code and APIs. I feel I acheived my main goal of understanding these concepts. I kept the page simple in order to maintain focus on my objectives.</p>

<h4>What I learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>How to use an API. This was a concept I found relatively easy to understand in the lessons but now feel comfortable now I have implimented these.</li>
<li>Learning about asyncronous code took a little longer to understand from the lessons, mainly because I struggled to find real world Javascript examples. Utilising asyncronous code solved this confusion</li>
<li>I implimented what I learnt about linting to make my code neater and used Prettier to also help me read JSON files.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Mistakes to learn from</h4>
<ul>
<li>I made a couple of errors at the start when trying to fetch certain data.

I can fix this by reading the documentation more thoroughly</li>
</ul>

<h4>Future improvements</h4>

<p>I am happy with the page. It is simplistic but acheives what I wanted it to. In the future I might create a more interesting error message as well as some details on the error. It might be good to also impliment the date and time. I have made a live counter using a tutorial before but think it would make a nice addition to the project.</p>
